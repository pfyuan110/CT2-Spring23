## Backgournd
With the irreversible trend of population aging around the world and the gradual development of technology, digital paradise becomes a reality. After reaching a certain age, humans can upload their consciousness (paid) into a virtual world with customizable age and social chronology. After death, they can choose whether to enter a digital paradise (paid) permanently, becoming an ageless and immortal digital life. <br>

The world is very sparsely populated except for the elderly. The population and resources are concentrated in large cities, while small cities have disappeared. Due to the destruction of the environment, the natural environment has become unsuitable for growing food. People have developed the technology to extract all kinds of nutrients for the human body from plants. People's food has turned into various nutrient solutions. Every family has a food laboratory that can be self-sufficient.<br>

Meanwhile, the food retains its former tantalizing look and taste in the digital paradise. The virtual environment is also very beautiful, preserving the natural beauty of the Earth at its best. As a result, the overly beautiful digital paradise tempts all living humans. **So, the euthanasia industry is growing rapidly and becoming increasingly commercialized.** Since there is a strict age limit for euthanasia, once many people reach the age limit, they are eager to buy euthanasia products and enter the digital paradise.<br>

Digital paradises also have rank distinctions. The rich have access to the freer and the best virtual worlds; the middle class has access to the better virtual worlds; and the cheapest, most available virtual worlds have the crimes and atrocities of real life. Nonetheless, all digital paradises are better than the harsh environment of the real world. But even the cheapest virtual worlds require a certain amount of money to enter. So for the lowest strata of society, after they have experienced bad real life, their consciousness and physical bodies can only return to the land.<br>

## Proposal
I would like to make a euthanasia Product to present the concept of **the last meal**.

I used DALL·E to generate this scene for reference.

#### Feedback
- Archeologies: it should be something that could be found after a period of time. So maybe thinking about the food package, the last drink (with some friction on it), the machine that makes the food, etc. And where would people like to conduct the euthanasia, in everyone’s home, factory, or friends’ homes?
- How to make others know that it is the last meal? No language since we don't understand the future language.


#### 02/19 Version 2
A tabletop machine for making food that helps people euthanize in their own homes. The materials used to make food are the common household nutrient solution of that time and the lethal ingredients that build in the machine. To make food, you simply input the nutrient solution from your home and select the desired food by holographic projection. Then all you need to do is just wait for the food to finish. <br>
Be noticed: this table machine has age limitation and costs some money, so it's not available to everyone.

I would like to use stylized material to render my scene. <br>
