# Virtual Dream Space

## Background
Mutiple Identity Space.
In today's Internet society, we all operate different identities on different social media. These different identities together constitute the person "ME". If these different identities were physically embodied, what would the space we live in become?

## Sketch
People in this space are made up of multiple embodied identities. Each person's certain identity may face a specific environment, but the same identity may also face different environments. The identities are rotaing, the environments are also changing.
