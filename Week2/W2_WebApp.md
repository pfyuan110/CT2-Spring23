# Project 1

## 1. Sensor
Flex senor and Stretch sensor (technically)

## 2. Function
Collect data on the degree of neck bending and visualize it using p5js.

## 3. Connection
Still figuring out how to process and analog the data from stretch sensor, so I use flex sensor as a test.

## 4. Code of ESP32
The same as Week 1.

## 5. Code of p5js
`https://editor.p5js.org/pfyuan110/sketches/yYzrSy-_W`

## 6. Result
### Data
It seems like 5s interval is not suitablt for flex sensor. When the sensor was kept bent at the same status, its value would gradually decrease in a short time.
