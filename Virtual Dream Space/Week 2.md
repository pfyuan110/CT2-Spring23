# Virtual Dream Space II

## Discription
- This is a surreal space with a vast, pure terrain. 
- Every time you click, there will be a 'thing' dropping into this world. So the world looks different every time it is interacted. The generation point of the falling object is at the location of the mouse click. The gravity and flexibility of each falling object are not the same. 
- The whole world will be highly saturated and full of glossy colors. I would like to play with different kinds of shaders or materials in this project.
- Acting as a viewer, each jump "I" make in this world will be affected by a very light gravity.

## Modeling
I created some surreal components in this world.

Additionally, I also made a simple grass to achieve the surreal effect.

## Unity
I made this flat and pure terrain to achieve a surreal effect. And I added my grass and wrote a shader to make the gradient color and let them wiggle by wind.

This world is an soft anti-gravity. Everything floats in the air and rise slowly. When you click, you could add a random object into this world. I am still working on the shader of objects.
